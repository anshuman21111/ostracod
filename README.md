# Project Overview
Simple model of male ostracod signalling deployed as a agent based model in NetLogo.

# Model Description
- number: number of ostracod in the model; ranges from 0-200
- perceptual-range: maximum distance at which an ostracod can perceive displays/brightness; ranges from 0-10.0
- sneaking-range-ratio: the percentage of the perceptual-range that forms a sneaking range (maximum distance an ostracod will sneak); ranges from 0-100%
- entrain-range-ratio: the percentage of the perceptual-range that forms an entraining range (maximum distance an ostracod will entrain); ranges from 0-100%
- display-rest-ratio: the percentage of the display-time that an ostracod needs to replenish its energy to display again; ranges from 0-100%
- entrain-rest-ratio: the percentage of the rest-time-display that an ostracod needs to entrain 
- display-time: How long an ostracod will display before resting and changing mating behavior
